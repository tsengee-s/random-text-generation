# random-text-generation
This repository includes a random story generator given a text file, using the Bigram Model to select the subsequent word based on weighted conditional probabilities, choosing the word that most frequently appeared consecutively with the previous word.
Performed on a cleaned version of the text file (cleaned input text by removing all punctuation, except periods, and converting everything to lower case).
